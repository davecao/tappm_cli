# A HMM-based predictor for TA proteins, implemented in python.
#
# TAPPM predicts TA proteins solely from target amino acid sequences according to
# the knowledge of the sequence features of TMDs and the peripheral regions of
# TA proteins. The hidden markov models of TA proteins as well as three different
# types of transmembrane proteins with similar structures and compared their
# likelihoods as TA proteins. Using these models, TAPPM achieved high prediction
# accuracy (area under the receiver operator curve values reaching 0.963).
#
# A web application of TAPPM is also available freely at
#  http://tenuto.bi.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tapp/

# Field description: seperated by tab key
# 1. name  : Query protein identifier.
# 2. seqLen: Query sequence length.
# 3. TA protein: Final decision is done by the three criterias:
#      A. the score is larger than or equal to the threshold.
#      B. The number of TMD segments is one.
#      C. The above mentioned TMD segment is overlapped with the C-terminal 
#         segment of 50 a.a.
# 4. isTA  : True or False, whether the query is TA protein or not based on score.
# 5. hasTMD: Whether the query protein contains TMD segment(s)
# 6. # of TMD segments: The number of TMD segments(>=15 a.a.)
# 7. score :  A decision value from TAPPM predictor used to compare with a threshold (see log)
# 8. likelihood: A likelihood value given by TA model
# 9. likelihood_mp: A likelihood value given by MP model
# 10. Positions of TMD segments: [(s, e) ... (s, e)]
# 11. The TMD segments (overlapped with Cter of 50 a.a.):
